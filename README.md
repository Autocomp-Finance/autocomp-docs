# What is Autocomp.finance ?

Autocomp Finance is Decentralized, auto-compounding yield optimizer running on Celo Network.
It maximizes earning potential in yield farming lifecycle by automating the reinvestment process.
Auto-compounding strategy is time tested and it works irrespective of bull or bear market.

Users can pick the 'Vault' and stake the crypto token. The investment strategy tied to the
specific Vault will automatically increase your deposited token amount by compounding the
arbitrary yield farm reward token back into your initially deposited asset. You can withdraw the investment at any moment in time.

# How Autocomp is different?

Autocomp was born out of Celo Networks bootcamp. With Celo being the mobile first blockchain,
Autocomp will be accessible from the native mobile App in the future.
