# What is the vault fee structure?

Most vaults have a performance fee structure, taking 4.5% of harvest rewards. This 4.5% on profits is again split up: 3.5% is allocated to treasury, 0.5% is for the strategist and 0.5% for callers. These fees are already built into the APY of each vault and daily rate. You do not need to calculate these yourself.
Furthermore, vaults have a withdrawal fee. The main purpose of this fee is to prevent possible exploits from bad-faith actors. Without the fee, somebody could deposit just before the harvest() function execution and withdraw straight after that event, taking a % of the gains generated by legitimate stakers. Withdrawal fees stay in the vault and are shared amongst vault funds.
