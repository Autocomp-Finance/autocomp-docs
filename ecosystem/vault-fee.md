# What is the vault fee structure?

Our performance fee structure takes 4.5% of harvest rewards. This 4.5% on the rewards are again split to: 3.5% is allocated to treasury, 0.5% is for the strategist and 0.5% for callers. The fees are built into the APY of each vault and daily rate.
Additionally, some vaults may have a withdrawal fee of 0.01%. The main purpose of this fee is to prevent possible exploits from bad-faith actors. Without the fee, somebody could deposit just before the harvest function execution and withdraw straight after that event, taking a % of the gains generated by legitimate stakers. Withdrawal fees stay in the vault and are shared amongst vault funds.
