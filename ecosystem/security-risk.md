# Security & Risks

In the space of crypto, especially in the Decentralised Finance (DeFi) space, users have to understand the risks of projects and smart contracts before investing into DeFi. We call this DYOR (do your own research).
As part of Autocomp long-term commitment to security and building trust within the community, we have laid out the ways in which we attempt to mitigate risks and provide a seamless experience on which our users can trust.

Impermanent loss happens when you provide liquidity to a liquidity pool, and the price of your deposited assets changes compared to when you deposited them.
